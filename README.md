# The highlights of my python projects

In this repository I have collected some of the coolest python projects I have done during the coding studies:
- RoboJump 3000 - a platform game made with Python's Pygame module
- Radial fade filter for images
- A probabilistic research on high blood pressure and coronary artery disease (linear and logistic regression)

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
5. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```

## Intro

So you just decided to add a README to your project. You want to create an easy
to read and easy to navigate file.

The question is: What should you do next?

Should you create one from scratch? Find a silver bullet solution? Or is it
better to customize an already existing file?

I'm going to show you how to create a README that fits your project, is easy
to read and contains everyting you will ever need.

## Feature overview

*   [x] **Easy to read** like an article
*   [x] **Feature overview and Contents** for fast orientation
*   [ ] **Visuals** to keep users engaged

## Contents

*   [What is this?](#what-is-this)
*   [When should I use this?](#when-should-i-use-this)
*   [Getting started](#getting-started)
    *   [Requirements](#requirements)
    *   [Install](#install)
    *   [Usage](#usage)
*   [Here is where it's your turn](#here-is-where-its-your-turn)
*   [Don't forget anything](#dont-forget-anything)
    * [Used Technologies](#used-technologies)
    * [Testing](#testing)
    * [Logging](#logging)
*   [Contribute](#contribute)
*   [License](#license)
*   [Sources](#sources)
*   [Conclusion](#conclusion)

## What is this?

This project is an exhaustive README template that you can customize to your needs.
You can either add sections you like or remove sections you don't like. But you have
every time an example in front of you, from which you can derive from.

## Why should I use this?

There are many README templates out there so why this one? The two main reasons for this are
that they contain often too little content or they are not easy to read or navigate through.

## Getting Started

So how do you get this template to work for your project? It is easier than you think.

### Requirements

* Have a project ready where you can add a README
* Basic knowledge of [Markdown][about-markdown] (here is a [Cheatsheet][markdown-cheatsheet])

### Install

Use git to clone this repository into your computer.

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/kopino4-templates/readme-template
```

### Usage

Use the well known command to copy the template

```bash
# Copy the content
CTRL + C

# Pase into your project
CTRL + V
```

## Here is where it's your turn

Here starts the main content of your README. This is why you did it for in the first place.
To describe to future users of this project (including yourself) everything they need to know
to be able to use it and understand it.

Use visuals to help the reader understand better. An image, diagram, chart or code example says
more than thousand words

![Diagram](doc/diagram.jpg)

## Don't forget anything

Think hard about anything that is clear to you but might not be clear for others. Why are you
using this aproach or why did you pick this solution instead?

### Used technologies

For sure mention all the technologies you used. If the technologies age in time you don't forget
they are used and need to be replaced.

### Testing

No tests no sucess. You SHOULD have tests for every project, but do new users know how to run them?

### Logging

Logging is essential. How do you know something went wrong if the computer doesn't tell you? Logs
are the first place to search for bugs. Explain to everybody how you can customize it or used it
in the right way.

## Contribute

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Conclusion

To summarize..

We have an exhaustive README template with many features. The README is easy to read and navigate like an article.
In our future projects we can use this template to get a great head start in creating a custom README.
